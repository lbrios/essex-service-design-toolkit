# Identify patterns

We have identified 7 service patterns across ECC:

## Check something
Check something helps users look up information and check whether it applies to them. When eligibility can be done separately from an application, it should be considered part of this pattern.

The scenarios are:

* check before you apply
* check to understand something
* check my nearest or most relevant

## Apply for something
Apply for something helps users to complete an application process.

The scenarios are:

* apply for a role or job
* apply for a grant or funding
* apply for consent or permission to do something myself
* apply for something we do or administer
* apply to appeal a decision

## Tell something
Tell something helps users to tell us something. Typically to update us about changes in circumstance. 

The scenarios are:

* report something
* report a safeguarding or legal concern
* feedback about something
* refer someone
* respond to something
* create to share
* update something

## Request something
Request something helps users to get something they want. Usually, there is no eligibility check as the user is entitled to what they want by default.

The scenarios are:

* request information or a document
* request financial compensation
* request for support or a service from us
* request to be added to something

## Register something
Register something helps users to complete a process. Users will create an account with personal and sensitive data that they can return to.

The scenarios are:

* register to create or share a thing
* register to apply for a role
* register to access an existing service, scheme or entitlement

## Pay for something
Pay for something helps users to transfer money to us.

The scenarios are:

* pay for an official status, record or event (something I have to do)
* pay to manage my account
* pay for an activity or service (something I want to do)
* pay to donate or support a service

## Book something
Book something helps users to book something, for example a room, an item or someoneâ€™s time. Most of these ask the user to select a date and time.

The scenarios are:

* book an appointment (time, person)
* book an asset or resource
* book onto an event that already exists
* book a place or space
