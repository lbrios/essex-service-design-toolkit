# i. Identify patterns

Indentify one of the 7 service patterns across our services.

## Check something
[Check something](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/overview) helps users look up information and check whether it applies to them. When there’s an application which depends on eligibility this should happen in this pattern rather than in the apply for something pattern.

The scenarios we've developed are:

* [check before you apply](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-before-you-apply/overview)
* [check my nearest or most relevant](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-my-nearest-or-most-relevant/overview)

The scenario still to be developed is:

* [check to understand something](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-to-understand-something/overview)

## Apply for something
[Apply for something](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/overview) helps users to complete an application process. Where there is eligibility criteria before an application is made this will be found in the 'check something' service pattern.

The scenario we've developed is:

* [apply for something we do](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-for-something-we-do/overview)

The scenarios still under development are:

* [apply for a role or job](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-for-a-role/overview)

* [apply for permission to do something myself](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-for-permission-to-do-something-myself/overview)

* [request information](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/request-something/request-information/overview)
* [request financial compensation](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/request-something/request-financial-compensation/overview)
