5.  Submits application

# Submits application
Whether the submission takes place online or offline, the user will want to know whether the submission has been successful. There should be an acknowledgment of an application through whatever channel the user has specified.

## User needs

The user needs are:

* I need to know my application has been received
* I need to know how soon I will get a response or decision

At the point of knowing their submission has been successfully received, the user will want to know how long they must wait to get a decision.

## User flow 

After filling in the application form, the user will submit the application for review.

The user will want to:

* know if the submission has been successful
* receive a acknowledgement of the application
* receive a summary of their application

## Considerations for the service 

Things to consider include:

* who the information needs to be sent to
* when it needs to be sent
* how it needs to be sent
* how offline versions will work
* how the user will know their application has been received

## Research considerations 

Consider the method of notification that gives users most confidence.

## Tech enabled interactions 

Things to consider include:

* an automated email confirmation with standard timeframes
* providing reference numbers so users can track their application and refer to it
* where the application will be stored
