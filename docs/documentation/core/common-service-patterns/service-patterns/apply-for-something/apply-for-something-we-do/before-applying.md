# Before applying

## Overview

The user has either searched for or landed on our website. The user is likely to be searching for information about the service. They are looking to see if they are eligible for a service before moving onto an application. See the [‘check before you apply’](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-before-you-apply/overview) flow.

## User needs

The user need are:

* I need to find out what I can apply for 
* I need to find what I am looking for without speaking council language 

## User flow 

There are 3 paths into the 'apply for something we do' scenario. These follow from the 'check before you apply' scenario:

* user has established eligibility where there are more than 4 criteria
* user has established their own eligibility where there are 4 or less criteria
* user comes straight to the application and there is no eligibility criteria

## Service considerations

Things to consider include:

* the life event triggered the user to come here
* what they’ve likely accessed before this service
* what information the user needs if they’re applying on behalf of someone else
* if this is the kind of service that users may complete on behalf of someone else - if so, how does that change the journey
* accessible offline versions of documents and applications
* whether this application impacts upon any other future decisions or access to other services
* whether there are legal or other requirements to access the service – see the [content strategy](/https://essex-design-system.herokuapp.com/docs/core/draft-content/content-strategy) for communicating these in an accessible way

## Data considerations 

Things to consider include:

* finding out if we have permission to share user information between services and partners, so that users do not have to repeat information we already know about them
* how fluctuations in demand might impact service provision

## Research considerations 

Think about the likely life event that’s led them to this.

## Tech enabled considerations

Things to consider include:

* if we can use information about the user from previous interactions with us so that they do not have to repeat information
* if this service is part of a bundle of services that users might access - if so, think about how the services might be linked behind the scenes
