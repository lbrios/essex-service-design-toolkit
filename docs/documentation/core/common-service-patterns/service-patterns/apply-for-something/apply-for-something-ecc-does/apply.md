# Apply
The user is ready to start their application. They need to understand why we are asking for certain information. Where the user needs to send evidence, this should be easy to do. 

## User needs

The user needs are:

* I need to understand why I am being asked for certain information
* I need to upload evidence quickly and easily 

## User flow 

Allow users to sign into their account to pull through their information (see the register pattern link). Users can only do this if they’ve previously completed an application and created an account with us. The user can then declare that their information remains unchanged, before the application is submitted for review. 

For new applications, users need to be told in plain English why they need to provide mandatory information. Where users need to provide evidence, make sure users can choose to send this either online and offline. For example:

* upload a digital document
* post the document

When the user is ready to submit the application, they should be asked to review and edit it. Once they’ve done this, the user should be asked to declare that information provided is complete and accurate and that they understand the implications of the application being submitted.

The user may be asked to make a payment at this stage. Refer to the ‘pay for something’ pattern.

## Considerations for the service 

Things to consider include:

* if users are told in plain English why they need to provide mandatory information – for example how it helps with decision making
* provide guidance throughout the application where there’s evidenced pain points
* making the user aware if there will be a handover between partners or departments - including why this is happening and what will happen next
* if the user is aware of all the supporting documents required
* if the user needs to confirm they’ve read and acknowledge policy from a legal, tech or policy perspective
* if users know the broken down cost if it’s a chargeable application
* if users know how long it will take to complete the application (LINK TO CONTENT STRATEGY)

Things to consider about additional support include:

* the different ways users can apply, so that it’s accessible to all users
* checking if partners are meeting accessibility standards so that users can access services
* the best way to support users if they get stuck - include multi-channel support

Things to consider about the application experience include:

* whether the user might resubmit the same information for multiple applications, for example applying for a job - if so, follow the register pattern to set up a user account
* breaking the application down into separate stages if it’s a multi-stage application
* if users can tell what stage they’re at and what’s next 
* if users don’t need to submit personal information, the application could be replaced by a different pattern such as [‘book something’](docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/book-something/overview)

## Research considerations 

Things to consider include:

* the parts of the application the user may get wrong and how can we help them correct it quickly and accurately
* the channels users may use to access the services
* the best measures to capture user experience across the journey
* what makes up a multi-stage application and what do we need to consider in the background to make it work
* the best method to submit evidence and when
* how to move users from offline to online
* how the user’s flow affects how applications are processed

## Tech enabled interactions 

Things to consider include:

* where personal information is required and during lengthy applications, add an option for an account to allow users to save progress and come back to the application
* using an accessible online form platform
* tech that recalls information from users' previous interactions – including the information the user shared in the 'check before you apply' pattern – so the user doesn’t have to tell us the same thing twice
* tech that logs the user out after a certain amount of time if information entered is sensitive - but always give them a minute's warning (or more depending on best practice)
* tech elements that help the user to correct any wrong answers
