5.  Next steps

# Next steps
Once the user has received an outcome, they will need to know what to do next.

If their outcome was unsuccessful, users will need to know what’s available for them.

There may be other services the user is eligible for given the evidence they have submitted. For example, if the user has met the low income policy, the user will need to know what other services might help them. 

## User needs

The user needs for next steps are:

* I need to find out what other schemes I’m eligible for 
* I need to know what else you can do to help or support me
* I need to know what support is available if I’m unsuccessful

## User flow 

There are several paths for the user after an outcome has been received.

If their application is successful, tell the user what happens next and if they’re eligible for other services. 

If their application is unsuccessful, give the user the option to appeal or challenge the decision (see [apply for something: appeal a decision](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-to-appeal-a-decision/overview) for further guidance). You could also point them to alternative guidance or services before their application journey ends. 

## Service consideration

Where users are unsuccessful, explain why.

## Research considerations 

Consider what users expect after finding out they’re not eligible.
