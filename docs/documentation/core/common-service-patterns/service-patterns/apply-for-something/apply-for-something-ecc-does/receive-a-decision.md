5.  Receive a decision

# Receive a decision
After the user submits their application, they will receive an outcome. 

## User needs

I need to find out what happens next.

## User flow 

The application will either be successful or unsuccessful. This will determine the next steps.

The outcome notification can be automated if the user prefers a digital communication method.

The user should not face any dead ends, even when an application is unsuccessful. 

## Considerations for the service 

Things to consider include:

* making sure the notification is sent by the userâ€™s preferred channel
* automating the notification of decisions and application status
* removing any dead ends for the user at the end of the apply process, for example signposting to other relevant services
* making sure users know where to go, what to do and who to speak to next

## Research considerations 

Consider the ideal time in an application to tell users when they will receive a decision.
