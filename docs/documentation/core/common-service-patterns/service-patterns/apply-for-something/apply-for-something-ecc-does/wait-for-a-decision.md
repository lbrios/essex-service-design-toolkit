5.  Wait for a decision

# Wait for a decision
After submitting the application, the user will wait for a decision and will be told how long it will take. The decision making process should be transparent. Users should know who and where they can get help from if they need it. 

## User need

I need to know the status of my application. 

## User flow 

Users should be told about any temporary changes to their application before a formal decision is received. 

If thereâ€™s a long time period between the application being submitted and the outcome received, communication is key to give the user assurance that their application is still being considered.

Alternatively, users could be able to track their status. This is an optional step in the flow - see check my status for further guidance. 

## Considerations for the service 

Things to consider include:

* telling the user when they will receive a response
* a method for the user to check their status or progress
* who users can contact from the service if they want an update
* telling the user about the decision making process is

## Research considerations 

Consider the best way to set expectations with users about timeframes after an application. Including what they need to know and how often communication should be.

## Tech enabled interactions 

Consider allowing users to track the status of their application if needed.
