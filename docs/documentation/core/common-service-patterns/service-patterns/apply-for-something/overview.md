# Apply for something
The 'apply for something pattern' (INSERT LINK TO APPLY FOR SOMETHING PATTERN) allows a user to receive or access a service. Where we are responsible for authorising an outcome for the user.  

The user will follow the check something pattern before using the ‘apply for something’ pattern.

Applications ask for personal and sensitive information, so we must keep the information safe and secure.

Think about whether an application is essential to help the decision making practice. 

If there’s no eligibility criteria, then consider moving users to a ‘book’ or ‘register’ pattern to continue their access to a service. 

There are 5 scenarios under the ‘apply for something’ pattern:

* apply for a role
* apply for funding  
* apply for permission to do something myself 
* apply for something we do 
* apply to appeal a decision
