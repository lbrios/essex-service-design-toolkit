# Book onto an event that already exists
This scenario describes a type of booking. This lets the user book and pay for a place to attend an already existing event. For example, a sports course or a music session.

Events could also be things like short breaks for carers. These are open at particular times during the year and need to be reserved ahead of time after the user’s identity has been confirmed. 

This scenario may contain ‘register for something’, ‘pay for something’ and ‘check something’ patterns within it, depending on the event or service.

There are 5 steps within the ‘book onto an event’ scenario: 

* browse information before booking [hyperlink]
* make a decision about whether to book a place [hyperlink]
* make the booking [hyperlink]
* submit the booking [hyperlink]
* next steps[hyperlink]
