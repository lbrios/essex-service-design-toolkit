# Browsing information prior to booking
This section happens just before the booking, when the user is browsing events. 

They have not yet decided to make the booking and are looking for more information.

## User need

I need to find out what’s happening, when it’s happening and where.

## User flow

The user can arrive at the booking of an event through 2 paths:

* the user has successfully applied for a service, received confirmation of their eligibility and is now wanting to use the service
* the user has browsed our website and is looking for an event

In both cases, the user will make a decision to book based on the event’s:

* location
* cost
* availability
* other factors

## Service considerations

Things to consider include:

* the motivations for booking - some users know they’d like to book and will check availability of an event or service
* if users have come from another service – there may be criteria to be met  before the user can book. For example, a needs assessment
* if it’s clear who should be making the booking

## Data considerations

Consider if there’s any data to show how people are arriving at the service and the demand on the service.

## Tech-enabled considerations

* Consider how users know about the event. For example online newsletters.

## Research considerations

Things to consider include:

* how users like to find out about events
* how users like to keep informed about events
* why people are exiting or failing their journey
