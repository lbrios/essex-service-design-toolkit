# Book something
The ‘book something’ pattern helps users to book something. For example a room, an item or someone’s time. Most of these ask the user to choose a date and time.

There are four scenarios under ‘book something’:

* [book onto an event (that already exists)](/docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/book-something/book-onto-an-event-that-already-exists/overview)
* [book an appointment](/docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/book-something/book-an-appointment/overview)
* [book an asset](/docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/book-something/book-an-asset/overview)
* [book a place](/docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/book-something/book-a-place/overview)
