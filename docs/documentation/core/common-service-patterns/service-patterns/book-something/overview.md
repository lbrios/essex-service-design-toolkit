# Book something
The ‘book something’ pattern helps users to book something. For example a room, an item or someone’s time. Most of these ask the user to choose a date and time.

There are four scenarios under ‘book something’:

* book onto an event (that already exists)
* book an appointment (time, person, place)
* book an asset or resource
* book a place or space
