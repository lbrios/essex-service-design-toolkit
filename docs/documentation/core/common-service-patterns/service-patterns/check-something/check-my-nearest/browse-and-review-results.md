# Browse and review results
Search results will be presented in a way that helps the user to make a decision.

## User needs

The user needs to see a list of results that are understandable, useful, useable and efficient so that they can make an informed decision. 

## User flow

The presentation may include a map with filters and a results list, a list of filtered results or a single result. The number of results generated will determine the most suitable presentation.

Where a search produces no results or leads to an error on the page, this will stop the user from completing their journey. 

## Considerations for the service

### More than 5 results generated

Consider:
 
* the best way to support users to search and browse through results
* matching results in order to make informed decisions. See the Content Strategy for help with writing clear and consistent content
* how users will make a comparison between results
* whether users can plot multiple points of interest and compare results with maps

### Less than 5 results generated

Consider:

* the best way for your users to see results - will a single result page or list of results be enough for users?
* what to do if a user canâ€™t find what they need - how can we support them, for example make suggestions? Consider giving the user an option to return to the filter page

If we reference a regulatory framework, for example an Ofsted report, make sure the user can easily access this.

## Research considerations

Think about:

* what will help users to browse information
* the best way for users to browse results

## Tech enabled interactions 

To design result pages, see the [Essex Design System](/docs/core/design/overview). Consider what functionality is needed to compare results.
