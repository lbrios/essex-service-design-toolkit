# Inputs information and filters
Search results will be generated and presented to the user at this stage.

## User needs

The user needs to generate results and work through them quickly to make a choice.

## User flow

If a small number of search results have been produced (less than five), the user can view them and make a choice. 

If multiple search results have been produced (more than five), the user needs to work through them. Using filters will reduce the cognitive burden on the user. 

In some situations, the user may be directed to a partner website to access results and will complete their journey there.

## Considerations for the service

Consider how many locations or types of services the user must navigate.

### More than 5 results generated

Consider a filter and sort function when there is:

* a unique piece of information that users can filter quickly, for example location data
* key information that users are looking for to help form a filter hierarchy and make a decision 
* pre-determined parameters that should be defined for the user, for example catchment areas 
* a benefit in the filtering or searching being split into steps

### Less than 5 results generated

Consider whether users are having difficulty to quickly see or understand where they can access services and what services are available to them. 

### Multiple results generated and directed to a partner site

Consider:

* if users know they will be directed to another site and if they can navigate back to us
* if users are informed of next steps once they have reviewed information with partners
* if partners are providing consistent information to support users to make a comparison between providers

## Data considerations

Things to consider include:

* any data that exists about things users are checking to find
* where users drop out of their search

## Research considerations 

Things to consider include:

* information thatâ€™s most relevant for users to help them make a decision to access a service, including unique filters
* the best way to search for something
* how users prioritise information

## Tech enabled considerations 

Ensure service information is up to date and accessible.
