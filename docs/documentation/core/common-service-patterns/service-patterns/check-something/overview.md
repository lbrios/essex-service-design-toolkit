# Check something
The check something pattern allows a user to look up information and understand if it applies to them. The information might be about their eligibility, status or location.

This is usually the first pattern in a user’s journey. It helps people make decisions early on before they engage with a service. For example, an eligibility check.

The pattern also keeps users up to date after they’ve used a service.

There are 3 scenarios under the ‘check something’ pattern:

* [check before you apply](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-before-you-apply/overview)
* [check to understand something](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-to-understand-something/overview)
* [check my nearest or most relevant](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-my-nearest-or-most-relevant/overview)
