# Check something
The check something pattern (LINK TO CHECK SOMETHING PATTERN IMAGE) allows a user to look up information and understand if it applies to them. The information might be about their eligibility, status or location.

This is usually the first pattern in a user’s journey. It helps people make decisions early on before they engage with a service. For example, an eligibility check.

The pattern also keeps users up to date after they’ve used a service.

There are 3 scenarios under the ‘check something’ pattern:

* check before you apply 
* check to understand something 
* check my nearest or most relevant
