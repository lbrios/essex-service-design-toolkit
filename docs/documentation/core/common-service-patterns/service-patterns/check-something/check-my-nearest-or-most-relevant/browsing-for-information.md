# Browses for information

## Overview

At this stage, the user is trying to identify something that meets their needs and is close to where they live or work.

The key action at this stage is for the user to be able to find out what the options are so they can decide what to do. 

## User needs

I need to find something that is most relevant for me. 

## User flow

In browsing for a relevant service, the user will either be presented with a single result based on their criteria, or be presented with a service that is offered across multiple locations or dates.

## Service considerations

Things to consider include:

* if the user would benefit from search criteria, for example by location and type of service
* if there are multiple locations and types of services for the user to navigate

## Research considerations 

You will need to consider what users are looking for and how users process information.

## Tech enabled considerations 

Things to consider include:

* ensuring online content meets accessibility standards
* offering an inclusive service, with multiple channels for users to access
