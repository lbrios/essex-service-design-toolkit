6.  Finding what they need

# Finding what they need
This is where the user will make a decision. It should be presented in a way that supports the user to make a confident choice. 

## User needs

The user wants to make a decision about the nearest or most relevant search result.

## User flow

The search results should allow the user to move quickly to the next action. 

If the search results are similar, provide the user the option to shortlist the results and compare them in a side by side table.

## Considerations for the service

Think about:

* whether the user needs extra support when browsing through the results
* if thereâ€™s an accessible policy or legal guidance available to help the user make a decision based on the results

## Tech enabled interactions 

Think about the option to save or download results.
