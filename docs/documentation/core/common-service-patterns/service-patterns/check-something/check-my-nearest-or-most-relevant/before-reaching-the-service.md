# Before reaching the service

## Overview

The initial actions of the user in navigating to the right source of information.

## User needs

I need to find out more information about a service I am interested in accessing. 

## User flow

Before reaching the service, the user is likely to have looked for service information that will give them confidence that the service is the right one to meet their needs. 

## Service considerations

Things to consider include:

* the user and their motivation for coming to the service
* the life event that triggered the need for the service
* other council services the user has interacted with before
* things the user should already know

## Research considerations

Things to consider include:

* how users typically come through to the service - how do they know the service exists
* the different types of users and their needs
