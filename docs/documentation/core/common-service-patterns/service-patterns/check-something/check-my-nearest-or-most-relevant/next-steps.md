# Next steps
The user has made a decision to either leave the site or complete their journey through a booking or application as quickly as possible.

## User needs

I need to know what to do next.

## User flow

The user might have enough information to finish their task and move off of the platform. Or, the user may need to follow another separate service pattern. For example, to apply for something or to book something.

If the search has failed to generate a result or has produced an error, the user should be signposted to another source of information. This will remove the need for them to contact the service.

## Considerations for the service

Think about:

* whether users know what to do next
* whether the result trigger an action from the service, for example, whether users should be directed to an application
* what happens if nothing fulfils the criteria for the user â€“ make sure there are no dead ends for the user
* if it would be helpful for users to have service contact information or signpost to other services

## Research considerations

Think about what users are typically looking to do following the check something journey. 

## Tech enabled interactions 

Think about the seamless transition into another pattern, for example apply for something.
