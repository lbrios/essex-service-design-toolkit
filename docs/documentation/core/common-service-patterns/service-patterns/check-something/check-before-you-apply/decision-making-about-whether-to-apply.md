# Decision making about whether to apply

## Overview
Once a user has decided a service may be relevant to them, they will need to find out whether they are eligible for the service they are applying for. The ways in which this can happen will vary by how complex the eligibility criteria are.

## User needs

I need to decide whether this service is the right thing for me

## User flow

The user will read the eligibility criteria and decide whether they are eligible to apply. 

These conditions determine whether a user can access a service.

Simple eligibility criteria includes 3 or less conditions.  Complex eligibility criteria includes 4 or more conditions. 

## Considerations for the service

Consider how many eligibility criteria there are:

* no criteria: user enters the start page of ‘apply for something’
* 3 or less criteria: user reads the eligibility criteria and finds out whether they are eligible to apply. If yes, user enters the start page of ‘apply for something’
* 4 or more criteria: user enters the smart question and answer format (decision path) to establish eligibility before ‘apply something’

## Research considerations

Research that needs to be considered includes:

* how the user decides what is worth their time
* what users need to make an informed decision to proceed with the check
* how many criteria is acceptable for the user to not go through a smart questions format
* what is the best way to make complex policy and legal frameworks accessible
* what criteria is hard to understand for users to make a decision, for example, pain points in the journey
