# User completes check

## Overview

There may be cases when the user does not know whether they are eligible, because the criteria or requirements cannot be established at first sight. For example, a user who is not automatically eligible to apply for a Blue Badge has to fulfil other criteria to be considered for a Blue Badge.

## User needs

I need help to find out whether I’m eligible for a service.

## User flow

For complex eligibility criteria (4 or more criteria), users should enter a smart question and answer format or ‘decision tree’ to find out whether they’re eligible  before applying. 

For complex criteria, an accessible explanation of what it means should be provided. This should include how the user can find out whether they fulfil it or not. 

## Considerations for the service

When there are 4 and more criteria, translate the eligibility policy into a smart question and answer format (decision tree).

Consider:

* what unique criteria are deal breakers to establish first - this will help establish a hierarchy in the decision tree
* providing guidance throughout the journey
* multi channels to support users should they need it 
* if additional documents are needed – if so, these need to be [accessible](https://essex-design-system.herokuapp.com/docs/core/accessibility/overview)
* if the service can provide users with the tools to check their own eligibility, for example maps to assess distance from home to school

## Research consideration

Consider the best channel for additional support.

## Tech enabled interactions

Things to consider include:

* making space for exceptional circumstances, for example free text boxes or multi channels options
* enabling users to check how accurate the information they provide is, by giving them appropriate tools to access
