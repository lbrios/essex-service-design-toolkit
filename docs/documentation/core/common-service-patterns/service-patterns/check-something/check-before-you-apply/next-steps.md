# Next steps

## Overview

The user has now received an outcome to their eligibility check. Whether the user was eligible or not eligible, they will need to know what to do next. 

## User need 

I need to know what to do next with this information.

## User flow 

If the user is eligible to access a service, they will either move onto the ‘apply for something’ or ‘book something’ patterns. 

If the user is not eligible to apply, they can either be signposted to another service, receive guidance on what to do next or they will leave this journey. 

## Service considerations

Things to consider include: 

* if there are dead ends for the user - users need to know where to go next, what to do and who to speak to
* if there is a way to navigate back to essex.gov.uk

## Data considerations

When a user is eligible for a service, consider what data should feed into their application. This will mean users do not have to duplicate the information they give us.
