# Common service patterns

## Overview
## What are service patterns?
Service patterns describes common behaviour as users use our services. They might want to check information, apply for something or book an event. But many of our services are implemented differently and offer users inconsistent experiences. If we understand the common patterns of behaviour, we can build services that feel consistent as users go from one service to another.

We have identified 7 patterns. We've broken these into smaller scenarios, for example, for the pattern 'check something' we identified:
* check before you apply
* check my nearest or most relevant
* check to understand something

## When to use this toolkit
This toolkit helps service designers working with service areas and tech services:
*	to understand what a specific pattern is
*	help solve problems
*	to make decisions of what patterns and guidelines are best for a service
*	to help design and create a interaction/transaction 
*	to contribute to its development
## How to use this toolkit
To get the most from the library follow these steps in this order:

* 1. [identify the most applicable service pattern](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/identify-patterns)
* 2. [map the ‘as is’ service](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/map-as-is)
* 3. [identify insights and design opportunities](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/identify-insights-and-design-opportunities)
* 4. [create a prototype](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/create-a-prototype)
* 5. [test the prototype](/docs/core/common-service-patterns/test-the-prototype)
