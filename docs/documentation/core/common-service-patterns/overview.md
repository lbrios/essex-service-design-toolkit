# Common service patterns

## Overview
Common service patterns are a shared set of guidelines and best practice to enable new ways of delivering the same types of experiences.

Services across ECC share similar types of transactions, interactions and usage of tech platforms. But many are designed and implemented differently and offer residents inconsistent experiences.

Common service patterns can be used to design and implement improved experiences at scale.

## Using service patterns

The steps below are a common approach to help apply a pattern to a service. To get the most from the library:

* [identify the most applicable service pattern](docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/identify-patterns)
* [map the ‘as is’ service](docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/map-as-is)
* [identify insights and design opportunities](docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/identify-insights-and-design-opportunities)
* [create a prototype](docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/create-a-prototype)
* [test the prototype](docs/documentation/core/common-service-patterns/test-the-prototype)
