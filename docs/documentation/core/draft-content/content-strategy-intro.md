## Introduction

Different departments across the organisation create content and publish it through a variety of platforms, including essex.gov.uk, a number of microsites, the intranet, social media, blogging platforms, email marketing and offline communications, such as letters, leaflets and policy documents.   
This presents challenges with:
- users struggling to find what they are looking for 
- poor user experience between different websites and platforms 
- keeping messaging consistent and up to date 
- content being duplicated
- understanding the role of content 
- understanding who is responsible for content 

Users want clear, relevant content that helps them achieve their goal.

In addition to this, there is a lack of clarity within the organisation on what good content is and how to make it accessible to everyone.    Common problems include:
- writing for the organisation, not the user
- writing in a confusing and complicated way instead of using plain English
- using jargon that people donâ€™t understand
- not writing inclusively for people with disabilities or low literacy

## Aim

The aim of this strategy is to help the organisation understand the importance of good  content and how it reduces barriers for users accessing services.
It should also help our content designers and editors to:
- have the confidence and autonomy to deliver good quality content based on user needs
- work efficiently using a clear workflow that covers the lifecycle of content
- learn, iterate and improve content based on data and user feedback

The outcome of this strategy is to give our users (citizens, business people and employees):
- clear, concise and current information
- a good user experience that enables them to easily find what they are looking for
- a professional and trustworthy image of Essex County Council

## Scope

This strategy covers:
- web content, including essex.gov.uk and microsites owned, managed and commissioned by Essex County Council        
- offline content, including letters, leaflets, brochures and consultations
- social media
- intranet content  
- email communications (broadcast, not personal)
- content related to digital tools and transactions, such as forms
- blogs
- interactive media including videos, gifs,  charts and graphs  
- applications and plug-ins owned by Essex County Council or used as part of our digital products

## Our core  values

We will deliver clear, user-focused content that can easily be accessed and understood by our users when they need it.

We will achieve this by making sure our content is:
- **clear and simple** - using plain English and writing for an appropriate reading age
- **user focused** - putting the needs of our users first when we create and publish content
- **accessible** - making sure everyone can access our content
- **consistent and current** - ensuring our information is accurate and up to date on all channels
- **authoritative** - we will only deliver content that reflects the services we offer and our expertise
- **based on data and research** - we will test our content with real users, listen to feedback and iterate to improve
