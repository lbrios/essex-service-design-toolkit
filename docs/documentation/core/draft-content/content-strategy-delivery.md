## Start with the user
Good content is designed around user needs. It’s what the user needs from your service and not what you want to tell them. 

Learn more about [user needs](/docs/core/users/user-need).

## What we publish

We will only publish content that:
- has a clear user need
- we have a statutory obligation to publish

## What we don’t publish

We don’t publish:
- content that doesn’t have a clear user need or isn’t something we have a statutory obligation to publish
- general advice that other organisations or charities could provide, for example [pregnancy advice from the NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/) 
- [frequently asked questions (FAQs)](/docs/core/content/what-to-do-with-faqs)
- anything that belongs to another organisation or has already been published on our site or another such as [how to set up a business on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business)
- legislation that’s on [legislation.gov.uk](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/)
- content that is in draft form, except consultations
- PDFs, Word or Excel documents that don’t meet [accessibility criteria](/docs/core/accessibility/overview)
- web pages with links to everything you might want to know about x topic, such as ‘web portals’

## Designing good content

Content should be: 
- simple 
- clear 
- direct 
- easy to read 

It needs to be as easy as possible for users to find the content, read it and complete their task. 

Good content: 
- is accessible and inclusive
- helps users complete tasks 
- helps build trust  
- makes users return to your content 
- encourages use of online services

Having style guidelines helps keep our content consistent, trustworthy and accessible. We use:
- the [Government Digital Service style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)
- tone of voice guidelines
- brand guidelines 

We also design and structure good content by:
- using plain English – see the [Plain English Campaign’s A to Z of alternative words](http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/the-a-z-of-alternative-words.html)
- using short sentences
- breaking up paragraphs with headings and bullets
- using active voice
- avoiding jargon
- using verb forms, instead of noun forms
- correctly formatting links
- front loading content
- avoiding duplication  
- not using bold, italics and underline

See our guidance on [designing and structuring content](/docs/core/content/designing-content).

## Designing for accessibility

We also design content in an accessible way so that it can be used and understood by as many people as possible, including those with:
- impaired vision
- motor difficulties
- cognitive impairments or learning disabilities	
- deafness or impaired hearing

See our guidance on [making content accessible](/docs/core/accessibility/overview).

## Optimising content for search

We know that most of our users come to our websites through searching on Google. Keywords are the common terms people use when searching for information, so it’s important to use the same keywords in your content.

Optimising your content for search will help users find it easily and quickly.

See our guidance on [optimising content for search](#) - CONTENT TO BE ADDED.

## Learning and iterating  

We will use data and feedback to learn if the content is achieving what it sets out to do and iterate to improve it. We will do this by:
- testing content with users
- monitoring data using tools like Google Analytics, Hotjar, GovDelivery and Hootsuite
- using tracking codes and short URLs for campaigns
- collecting feedback from users - this could be through the website, contact centre or service area
