## Content designers and editors

Content designers and editors are responsible for:
- writing and designing content based on our guidelines
- establishing user needs
- choosing the best format for content based on user needs
- publishing content to a high standard

## Content owners and subject matter experts

Content owners should hold a senior position, such as head of service. They have overall responsibility for the service offer and are therefore accountable for its content.

Subject matter experts (SMEs) should work in the service area and have an in-depth knowledge of how the service operates.

They can be the same person or the content owner can assign an SME in their team to work with content designers and editors to:
- establish user needs
- share data and research
- fact check content
- review and monitor content

Content owners have overall responsibility for fact checking content ready for publication.

Content owners and subject matter experts are responsible for ensuring their content is accurate and up to date. If changes need to be made, they should contact the Content team.
