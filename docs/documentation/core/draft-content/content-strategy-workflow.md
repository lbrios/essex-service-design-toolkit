# Workflow

Contents:
- [Managing content requests](#managing-content-requests)
- [Before starting a content project](#before-starting-a-content-project)
- [Content lifecycle](#content-lifecycle)

## Managing content requests

Requests for new content or changes to existing content should go to the Content team. Regular and planned updates should be added and managed through the content calendar.
Updates to existing content can be made immediately at the Content team’s discretion if it’s: 
- factually incorrect
- out of date - such as prices, dates, opening hours and contact details
- an error - including spelling mistakes and broken links

These updates must meet our [content guidelines](content-strategy-delivery) but don’t need to follow the content lifecycle.

Requests for new content or significant changes to existing content should follow the [content lifecycle](#content-lifecycle). 

Requests for microsites or new technical functionality should go to the Tech Services Design Board (LINK TO BE ADDED).

## Before starting a content project 

Before planning your content project, you need to consider the following:
- is there a valid user need? who content is for and why they need it
- is it our job to publish the content?
- is the information, advice or guidance available elsewhere? are you duplicating content?
- what is the best platform to use? is it essex.gov.uk, a social media post or a blog post?

Go ahead if:
- there’s a clear user need
- it’s our statutory obligation to publish it
-	it's a service we provide

You must have evidence to back the user needs. This could be Google Analytics data, call centre data or feedback from users.

Don’t go ahead if:
- there isn’t a valid user need
- it’s already published elsewhere, like NHS or GOV.UK - we should signpost
-	it’s not our job to publish it

## Content lifecycle

The content lifecycle shows how content goes from inception to publication, to iteration.

            <li>what they want to achieve</li>

        <p>A typical content discovery includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>gathering data and research - this can include auditing existing content, gathering user feedback and website analytics, researching keywords and reviewing customer contact with the service</li>
          <li>a kick-off meeting with relevant content owners and subject matter experts to understand their service, the challenges they face and understand if there are legislative requirements and technical dependencies for the content</li>
          <li>testing existing content if possible - this will help to understand the user journey and highlight what might need to change</li>
          <li>writing and validating user needs based on the information gathered</li>

        <p>After your discovery phase, you can start to design and write content. The goal for the design phase is to have a prototype that can be tested with users.</p>
        <p>A typical content design phase includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>writing the content based on what you know from the discovery - you can pair write  with another content designer, the content owner or the subject matter expert</li>
          <li>choosing the right platform and format for the content, based on the user needs</li>
          <li>prototyping the content  so it can be tested with users and shown to stakeholders</li>

        <p>When your content has been drafted, ask another content designer to read your content and provide feedback. This is called ‘peer review’.</p>
        <p>Content should be peer reviewed against our style guide and the user needs.</p>
        <p>You can iterate your content based on the peer review and have it peer reviewed more than once if you feel it’s helpful.</p>

        <p>When it’s been agreed that the content is factually correct, it can be published then promoted.</p>
        <p>It’s a good idea to ask someone else, such as another content designer, to check the content when it’s live. They should check:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>spelling</li>
          <li>links</li>

        <p>Content owners and subject matter experts are responsible for promoting the content. This could be done by the service area or with input from other teams such as Communications.</p>
        <p>They should also make sure any print materials, emails and other publications contain up to date links for this content.</p>

        <p>Before content is unpublished you should:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>get agreement from the content owner</li>
          <li>check if there are short URLs linking to the content - if there are, these should be removed or redirected</li>
          <li>plan and create a redirect for the content so users don’t experience broken links</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Content owners and subject matter experts should also remove any reference to the content from other publications such as documents, emails, marketing material and other websites.</p>
