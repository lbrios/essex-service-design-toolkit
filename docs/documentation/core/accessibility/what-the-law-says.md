# What the law says

New regulations came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. This means that we now have a legal duty to make sure that our online services are accessible.

The Government Digital Service (GDS) has guidance which explains the 3 compliance deadlines and exemptions:

-   a new website, published on or after 23 September 2018, must be accessible by 23 September 2019
-   an existing website must be accessible by 23 September 2020
-   a mobile app must be accessible by 23 June 2021

GDS has also provided the following guidance on:
- [understanding new accessibility requirements for public sector bodies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps#procuring-an-accessible-website-or-app)
- [making your website or app accessible and publishing an accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement)
