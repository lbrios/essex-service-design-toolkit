# What the law says

New regulations came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. This means that we now have a legal duty to make sure that our online services are accessible.

The Government Digital Service has guidance which explains the 3 compliance deadlines and exemptions:

*   a new website, published on or after 23 September 2018, must be accessible by 23 September 2019
*   an existing website must be accessible by 23 September 2020
*   a mobile app must be accessible by 23 September 2021
