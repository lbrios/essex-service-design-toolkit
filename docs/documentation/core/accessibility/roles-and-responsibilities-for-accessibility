# Roles and responsibilities for accessibility

Everyone that is involved in commissioning or delivering digital products for Essex County Council shares has responsibility to make sure that they are accessible to all.

The Government Digital Service Standards make it clear that we should:

* [understand users and their needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-1-understand-user-needs)
* [make the service simple to use](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-4-make-the-service-simple-to-use)
* [make sure everyone can use the service – after all, users often don’t have a choice](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service)

The following guidance is for specific roles:

* user researcher
* content designer
* developers
* product owners and delivery managers
