# Roles and responsibilities for accessibility

Everyone that is involved in commissioning or delivering digital products for Essex County Council shares has responsibility to make sure that they are accessible to all.

The Government Digital Service Standards make it clear that we should:
- [understand users and their needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-1-understand-user-needs)
- [make the service simple to use](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-4-make-the-service-simple-to-use)
- [make sure everyone can use the service – after all, users often don’t have a choice](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service)

The following guidance is for specific roles:
- [user researcher](#user-researcher)
- [content designer](#content-designer)
- [developers](#developers)
- [product owners and delivery managers](#product-owners-and-delivery-managers)
- [working in an agile team](#agile-phases)

## User researcher

The user research role is an important one as they help to identify accessibility issues by testing with disabled users. 

See Government Digital Service (GDS) [guidance on including users with disabilities](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants).

It’s important to understand the challenges faced by users with specific disabilities or impairments. 

GDS have developed personas which identify the range of challenges faced by users. See the profiles:

- [Ashleigh: partially sighted screenreader user](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/ashleigh-partially-sighted-screenreader-user)
- [Christopher: user with rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/christopher-user-with-rheumatoid-arthritis)
- [Claudia: partially sighted screen magnifier user](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/claudia-partially-sighted-screen-magnifier-user)
- [Pawel: user with Asperger's](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/pawel-user-with-aspergers)
- [Ron: older user with multiple conditions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/ron-older-user-with-multiple-conditions)
- [Saleem: profoundly deaf user](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/saleem-profoundly-deaf-user)
- [Simone: dyslexic user](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/simone-dyslexic-user)

Further reading:

Read the [‘accessibility and me’ blog post](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/category/accessibility-and-me/) which has interviews with people with access needs.

The [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/) also has stories of people with disabilities using the web which highlight the effect of accessibility barriers.

### Testing

There are a number of assistive technologies which can be bought or downloaded for free. These help to identify issues early on. GOV.UK has guidance on [testing with assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).

## Content designer

Watch a 3.5 minute video from GDS on [ways to make your content more accessible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZJKr8CX_U&list=PL5tovFCB3CsD_7_yeY1n6W4rxYkIupUln&index=6).

### Writing content for specific impairments

See our guidance on [how to write content for specific impairements](/docs/core/accessibility/examples-of-how-to-write-content-for-specific-impairments).

- [adding alternative text on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/214124458607871)

### Content types: text Headings

Content should always be structured on a web page or in a document. This means that it should always have a title which is a heading 1 or h1 in the code.

Anything more than a couple of paragraphs probably needs to have sub-headings. This helps the user to scan the content to find what they need. These sub-headings are heading 2 or h2 in the code.

See our [guidance on designing good content](/docs/core/content/designing-content).

See [WCAG guidance on headings](http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/).

Read Nomensa's blog post on [structuring accessible content](https://www.nomensa.com/blog/2017/how-structure-headings-web-accessibility).

### Content types: videos

Dig inclusion has guidance on [what makes a video accessible](https://diginclusion.com/resources/what-makes-a-video-accessible/?cn-reloaded=1&cn-reloaded=1).

### Creating accessible documents

Provide content on a web page rather than as a PDF. If this isn’t possible then the following should be done as a minimum:
- write in plain English
- tag headings and other parts of the document properly, so screen readers can understand the page structure
- make sure we include alt text alongside non-decorative images, so people who cannot see them understand what they’re there for
- avoid using tables, except when we’re presenting data

See our guidance on [creating accessible documents - TO ADD](#).

GDS has a blog on [why content should be published in HTML and not PDF](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/16/why-gov-uk-content-should-be-published-in-html-and-not-pdf/).

### Consultations

A consultation with a broad audience should be made as accessible as possible using the different formats. With a narrower audience, consultations must offer an alternative version, if requested, within a reasonable timeframe.

GDS has a [blog post which gives accessibility advice for creating a consultation](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/13/accessibility-advice-when-creating-a-uk-government-consultation/).
