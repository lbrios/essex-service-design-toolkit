# Web or PDF content?

Before creating a document to be uploaded onto the website you need to ask if it should be a document at all.

PDFs are not the best solution because:

*   the content can't be searched by Google or the website search
*   they are not designed to be read on mobile devices
*   they can quickly become out of date with broken links

The Government Digital Service (GDS) has a blog post on [why gov.uk content should be published in HTML not PDF](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/16/why-gov-uk-content-should-be-published-in-html-and-not-pdf/)

If you have a piece of content that needs to be read before residents can access our services, then this should almost always be added to the website as web content rather than as a PDF.

Content needs to be written appropriately whether it's in a PDF or on a web page. It won't be added to the website unless it follows the [GDS content standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk)
