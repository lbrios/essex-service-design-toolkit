# Why digital accessibility is important

Making a website or mobile app accessible means making sure it can be used by as many people as possible.

This includes those with:

*   impaired vision
*   motor difficulties
*   cognitive impairments or learning disabilities
*   deafness or impaired hearing

Accessibility means more than putting things online. It means making your content and design clear and simple enough so that most people can use it without needing to adapt it, while supporting those who do.

People may not have a choice when using a public sector website or app, so itâ€™s important they work for everyone. The people who need them the most are often the people who find them hardest to use.

Accessible websites are better for everyone. For example, they are faster and easier to use, and appear higher in search engines.
