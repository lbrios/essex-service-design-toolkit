# Tools for checking accessibility compliance


## SiteImprove

This is a tool which checks all aspects of a website's compliance with good practice standards, not just accessibility. It checks for:

*   broken links
*   spelling errors
*   accessibility
*   search engine optimisation

If you manage the content for one of Essex County Council's websites or you develop websites in Tech Services, please email [service.design@essex.gov.uk](mailto:mailtto:service.design@essex.gov.uk "email service design team")

We are working with Siteimprove to develop a training package to support staff responsible for developing or maintaining websites.

## Wave accessibility checker

This is a free tool which will assess the accessibility of single pages. You just need to add the web address of the page that you're interested in.

Use the [Explore Wave accessibility checker](http://wave.webaim.org/ "Explore Wave accessibility checker").

## Reading age

GOV.UK recommends [writing for a reading age of 9](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk "link to GOV.UK"). An assessment of reading age can be given by pasting an example of your content into the [Readability Formulas website](http://www.readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php "Readability Formulas website").

## Colour contrast checks

You can check the accessibility of the colour contrast, using this free tool from WebAim. You will need to have the Hexadecimal colour codes handy.

Use the [WebAim colour contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAim colour contrast checker").

You can check colour contrast that includes transparency, using this free tool by Joe Dolson. You will need to have either of the following colour codes handy:
