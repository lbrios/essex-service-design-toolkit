# Checklist for content editors

To meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) to level AA you must be able to answer 'yes' or 'not applicable' to all of the following questions.

Answering 'no' means that you are not meeting WCAG and your content will have barriers that will prevent some users, especially disabled users and older people from accessing it.

The following is a checklist for content editors. You should also be aware there is also a [checklist for developers](checklist-for-developers "Checklist for developers").

## Text

Does each page have a unique title that indicates its purpose and context? Are headings and labels clear and descriptive?

Has the correct heading structure been applied to the content?

Is the purpose of every link clear from its link text?

## Images

Do all images have an appropriate text equivalent? Is essential visual information also available as text?

Have you avoided using images of text?

## Audio

Do all audio files have a transcript? Is essential audio information available as text?

Can users stop audio that auto plays?

## Video

Do all videos have captions that are synchronised with the audio?

Does video that includes important visual information have an audio description?
