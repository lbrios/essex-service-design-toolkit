# Using images on web pages

Only use images if it adds value and purpose to your content. For example, images showing:

* different types of potholes to report a dangerous pothole 
* different wedding venues for weddings 
* a caravan's internal layout for booking short breaks

Don’t use images for decorative purposes unless it’s for a news story or a social media post.

## Make your images accessible

If you’re adding images to a web page, make sure they are accessible to everyone including those that use assistive technologies. 

### Alternative text (alt text)

Add a meaningful and useful alt text. Alt text allows screen readers to describe the image to people with visual impairments.

Think about the context of the image. If race, ethnicity, gender, or age are relevant to the information the image is providing, then include this in the alt text. For example, if the image is for a news story, campaign or content about race and ethnicity.

Keep alt texts brief but concise.

Don’t start with ‘image of’ or ‘photo of’. The user will usually know that it's an image.

Here’s an example of a good and descripted alt text.
Insert image
Alt text: Doctor writing up notes in surgery

Here’s an example of a bad alt text. 
Insert image
Alt text: Nominations open for the 2020 Essex Teaching Awards

Don’t repeat the surrounding text like the title of a news story or guidance it relates to. 

See [create accessible documents for more guidance - ADD LINK](#).

### Text on images

Don’t include text on your images. This is not accessible for people using screen readers. Search engines also cannot read information in images.

If the text is an important part of the content, write it in the body content.

## GIFs and animation

GIFs and animation are distracting and people with seizure disabilities or sensitivity to motion may dislike moving or flashing images.

GIFs and animation should only be used if there’s a clear user need. This could be in video format. If you’re using them to explain something, provide a text alternative, captions or transcripts in the body text. 

## Using complex images or diagrams

This includes flow diagrams or infographics.

Consider whether the information on diagrams or illustrations is better presented with text including headings and sub headings.

If these flow diagrams or illustrations help add more information and make things clearer, then include them and provide alternative text in the body content.

You should:
- add diagrams and illustrations as one image and not as separate components
- add alt text
- save them as .png files as this format is better for diagrams that include text and clear lines

## Logos

Don’t use logos to brand web pages or acknowledge partners. Logos should only be used if there’s a clear user need. For example, using the Verify Visa logo for taking payments as this is seen as a trusty source.

[GOV.UK has more guidance on using logos](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/use-of-government-logos-on-gov-uk).

## Buttons and icons

These should only be used if there’s a clear user need and not for decorative purposes.

For example, see our [contribution calculator](https://www.essex.gov.uk/start/care-contribution-calculator) which has a start button that serves a function.

## Image maps

Don’t use geographical maps as images unless they are essential to the content. For example, you can use interactive maps like Google maps. 

Provide a text alternative in in the body content for users who aren’t able to use the map. This could be the address and directions to get to the location. See our [visit us](https://www.essex.gov.uk/visit-us)
page.

## Adding images on webpages

Images should be:

* in landscape format
* high resolution that can be resized appropriately
* less than 500KB per image
* saved as .jpeg files – this format is better for photographs

Avoid using images with a white background. Use background colours to give good colour contrast.

## Images and copyright

Only include images that you have permission to use.

If you’re using images with copyright restrictions, make sure you give the appropriate credit to the owner.

If you’re using photographs of people, make sure you have their consent before using them.
