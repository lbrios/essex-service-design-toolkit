# Before starting a content project

Before planning your content project, you need to consider the following:

*   is there a valid [user need](contents "User need and user behaviour")? who content is for and why they need it
*   is it Essex County Council’s (ECC's) job to publish the content?
*   is the information, advice or guidance available elsewhere? are you duplicating content?
*   is essex.gov.uk the best platform to use? could it be a social media post or a blog?

Go ahead if:

*   there’s a clear user need
*   it’s ECC's statutory obligation to publish it
*   it's an ECC service

You must have evidence to back the user needs. This could be Google Analytics data or feedback from users.

Don’t go ahead if:

*   there isn’t a valid user need
*   it’s already published elsewhere, like NHS or GOV.UK
*   it’s not ECC’s job to publish it
