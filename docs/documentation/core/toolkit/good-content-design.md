# Good content design

## Start with the user

Good web content is designed around user needs. Itâ€™s what the user needs from your service and not what you want to tell them.

Start by [learning who you are designing for](contents "User need and user behaviour").

## Designing good content

Content should be:

*   simple
*   clear
*   direct
*   easy to read
*   authoritative

You need to make it as easy as possible for users to find, read the content and complete their task.

Good content:

*   helps users complete tasks
*   helps build trust
*   makes users return to your content
*   encourages use of online services
