# Tools for checking accessibility compliance


## SiteImprove

This is a tool which checks all aspects of a website's compliance with good practice standards, not just accessibility. It checks for:

*   broken links
*   spelling errors
*   accessibility
*   search engine optimisation

If you manage the content for one of Essex County Council's websites or you develop websites in Tech Services then please email [service.design@essex.gov.uk](mailto:mailtto:service.design@essex.gov.uk "email service design team")

We are working with SiteImprove to develop a training package to support staff responsible for developing or maintaining websites.

## Wave accessibility checker

This is a free tool which will assess the accessibility of single pages. You just need to add the web address of the page that you're interested in.

## Reading age

GOV.UK recommends [writing for a reading age of 9](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk "link to GOV.UK"). An assessment of reading age can be given by pasting an example of your content into the [Readability Formulas website](http://www.readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php "Readability Formulas website").

## Colour contrast checks

You can check the accessibility of the colour contrast, using this free tool from WebAim. You will need to have the Hexadecimal colour codes handy.
