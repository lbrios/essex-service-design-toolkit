Why accessibility is important
==============================

Making a website or mobile app accessible means making sure it can be used by as many people as possible.

This includes those with:

*   impaired vision
*   motor difficulties
*   cognitive impairments or learning disabilities
*   deafness or impaired hearing

Accessibility means more than putting things online. It means making your content and design clear and simple enough so that most people can use it without needing to adapt it, while supporting those who do.

People may not have a choice when using a public sector website or app, so itâ€™s important they work for everyone. The people who need them the most are often the people who find them hardest to use.

Accessible websites are better for everyone. For example, they are faster and easier to use, and appear higher in search engines.

Accessibility legislation
-------------------------

New regulations came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. This means that we now have a legal duty to make sure that our online services are accessible.

The Government Digital Service has guidance which explains the 3 compliance deadlines and exemptions:

*   a new website, published on or after 23 September 2018, must be accessible by 23 September 2019
*   an existing website must be accessible by 23 September 2020
*   a mobile app must be accessible by 23 September 2021
