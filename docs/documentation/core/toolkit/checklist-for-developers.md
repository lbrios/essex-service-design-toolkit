Checklist for developers
========================

To meet WCAG 2.1 to level AA you must be able to answer YES or Not Applicable to all of the following questions.

Answering NO means that you are not meeting WCAG and your content will have barriers that will prevent some users, especially disabled users and older people from accessing it.

The following is a checklist for developers. You should also be aware there is also a [checklist for content editors](checklist-for-content-editors "Checklist for content editors").

Text
----

Does the website prevent duplicate page titles being created?

Is there a format dropdown with pre-defined headings that can be applied to content?

Audio
-----

Can users stop audio that auto plays?

Structure
---------

Is all content structure that is communicated visually available to assistive technologies? (Are headings formatted correctly with h1, h2 tags? Any other structural elements on the page missing tags, i.e tables, buttons, etc.)

If styling is removed is the content in a logical order?

### Code

Is the web page coded using valid HTML?

### Forms

Do forms provide helpful, understandable error and verification messages?

On forms and other components is the accessible name or label the same as any on-screen text?

### Keyboard control

When using a keyboard to move through a page does the order make sense?

When using a keyboard to move through a page can you tell where you are?

Can blocks of links and other interactive elements be bypassed by keyboard users?

### Design, features and functionality

Do all interactive components have an accessible name and role, and when required state? Has the correct ARIA mark-up been used and does it validate?

Are status messages and updates given appropriate roles that can be understood by AT, without receiving focus?

Have you avoided links, controls, or form fields that automatically trigger a change in context?

Does the website include consistent navigation?

Are features with the same functionality labelled consistently?

Do you have shortcuts triggered by only one letter or character? If so can they be turned off or remapped by the user?

Does some of your site functionality need several fingers or complex gestures to operate it?

Does some of your site functionality work using a single point (e.g fingertip) and is it triggered the moment it is touched?

Does your site respond to motion or movement to operate parts?

Has the language of the web page or document (or individual parts of a multilingual document) been defined?

Does the website have two or more ways of finding content, such as a navigation menu, search feature, or site map?

Can all menus, links, buttons, and other controls be operated by keyboard?

Have you avoided using visual characteristics to communicate information?

Have you avoided using colour as the only way to convey some information?

Does all text have sufficient contrast against the background colour?

Is the content fully usable when text is enlarged up to 200%?

Can users flip the content horizontally and vertically?

Have you added HTML autocomplete tokens to any forms collecting information about the user?

Does the page content resize to a single column with no horizontal and vertical scrolling?

Do all important graphical objects, interface components, and states have a colour contrast of 3:1?

Can line height, spacing between paragraphs and letter and word spacing be changed without breaking anything?

Where extra content is shown or hidden on focus, can it be dismissed, interacted with (and not disappear when the user moves to it) and will stay visible until dismissed by the user?

Do pages that have time limits include mechanisms for adjusting those limits?

Can any content that moves or auto updates be stopped?

Have you avoided using content that flashes or flickers?
