Insight and discovery
=====================

Before you do anything to change an existing service or create a new one you need to put some time into discovery and insight.

Understanding existing products and services
--------------------------------------------

Find out as much as you can about how successful the existing products or service is for users. Use the following to inform you:

*   Google Analytics data
*   Online feedback
*   Phone call volumes and anecdotal insight from the advisors
*   [User testing](user-testing "User testing")

Analysing multiple sources of data means that you have a rounded view of behaviour. Itâ€™s only when you do this that you start to see the whole picture which may be lost by just looking at web stats.

**For example:  
**You can identify services which have high call volumes for general information queries which would suggest that we need to do some work to promote or improve our online services.
