Creating an accessible PDF
==========================

Most PDFs are created from an original Word document. If the Word document isn't accessible then the PDF won't be either.

Example of an [accessible PDF](/media/576695/accessible-pdf.pdf "accessible-pdf.pdf") which has been created from an accessible Word document.

Guidelines for creating an accessible document
----------------------------------------------

### Accessible content

A significant number of people have a low reading age. If you are writing content that is more appropriate for someone with a degree, then you are excluding users.

Professionals need content in Plain English too. They need to be able to find information quickly.

Read the [guidance on writing accessible content](/content/designing-content/)

### Heading styles and formatting

*   Headings must have the correct heading level style applied and these must follow a logical order. This means that Heading 1 should always be followed by Heading 2  
    Note: Do not create your own headings by applying different font sizes or using bold
*   Appropriate normal, bullet and hyperlink styles have been used.  
    Note: Do not use tabbing to create an indent
*   Make sure the table of contents has been updated, and that page numbers are correct
*   Make sure that there are no extra returns using the 'reverse P'

### Links

All links within a document should have appropriate link text. An example would be [Essex County Council](https://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx) instead of [https://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx](https://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx)

If you add a web address as above, a screen reader will read it out to the user and it won't make a lot of sense.

### Images

Images should have descriptive alt text (alternative text) that describes the meaning of an image to the user. This can be read by assistive technologies, which helps make sure more of your audience can access your content.

### Tables

*   Use alt text. The contents of the table can be accessed by a screen reader so alt text only needs to be a short summary of what the table shows. You don't need to detail the content
*   Tables have designated header and row styles applied
*   Merged cells need to be removed from tables
*   More complex tables using split cells may need to be split into separate tables, or have title rows removed from cells and replaced with headings.
*   Check that the tabbing order is correct. Can the screen reader read the table information in a logical order?

### Diagrams and inserted objects

Check all objects to make sure that they have been inserted as a single image with alt text, rather than being made up of a lot of separate component parts.

For diagrams and charts you must ensure that the information the chart shows is available in written form, either in the body text or in alt text.

Colour contrast
---------------

*   Colour should not be used as the only means of communicating information. It must be stated clearly elsewhere.
*   Avoid using colours such as red and green to indicate that things are right or wrong. This is meaningless if you are colour blind.
*   If there are shaded cells in call to action boxes or table headers, for example, you need to check that the contrast is enough using a contrast checker
