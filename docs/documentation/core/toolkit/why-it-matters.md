# Why it matters

Services designed around users and their needs:

*   are more likely to be used
*   help more people get the right outcome
*   cost less to operate by reducing time and money spent on resolving problems

Other considerations are:

*   We committed to providing value for money and delivering digital services that get it right first time supports this
*   We have agreed corporately that weâ€™ll adopt the [GDS Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and 'understand user need' is standard 1
*   There is a legal duty to deliver accessible services to all and we need to understand the needs of users who have physical, mental, visual or auditory disabilities
