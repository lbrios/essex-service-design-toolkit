### Using link boxes

Link boxes are usually displayed on topic pages and help to signpost users to the most popular or useful content within that section.

The are likely to link to internal content but could sometimes link to external content - usually another site within the essex.gov.uk web estate.

Link boxes should always have:
<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>a link to another page of content</li>
  <li>clear and concise link text</li>
  <li>a short description of what the user can expect to find on the page</li>
</ul>
They shouldn't have:
<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>lengthy text</li>
  <li>email addresses or telephone numbers</li>
  <li>additional formatting such as bold, italics or lists</li>
</ul>
