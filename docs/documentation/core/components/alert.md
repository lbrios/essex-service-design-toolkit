### Using alerts

Alerts are used to direct a user's attention to important information. This could include:
<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>adverse weather information</li>
  <li>technical problems or maintenance on the website</li>
  <li>changes to regular council services</li>
</ul>

An alert can be displayed on the homepage or on lower level pages, depending on the topic and severity. They should always be clear and concise and link to another page with further information if necessary.

They shouldn't be used within paragraphs of text.
