### Using panels

A panel is a visual aid to differentiate an excerpt of text from the body of content. It should contain information that's useful or important to the user.

It can be embedded anywhere within the body content of a page.

It shouldn't be used instead of an <a href="/docs/core/components/alert">alert</a> which should provide very important information for a limited time.
