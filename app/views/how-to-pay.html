        How to pay

        What are direct payments?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Direct payments are payments we make to you so you can arrange the care and support we have agreed you need. You can arrange and pay for your own care and support instead of us doing it for you.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">
        How can I get direct payments?
      </h2>
      <p>
        If youâ€™re an adult (over 18) and already getting support from us, you can ask for direct payments. Ask your social care worker for information and advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're not already getting support from us, you can ask us to complete an assessment to work out how much care and support you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount you get depends on your income and savings. We will carry out a <a href="https://www.essex.gov.uk/Health-Social-Care/Health-and-social-care-for-adults/charging-for-care-services/Pages/financial-assessment-process.aspx">financial assessment</a> to tell us how much you can afford to pay towards your care and support. Your contribution, if any, is deducted from the direct payment before you receive it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You won't be invoiced for the direct payments.
      </p>

        Carer's direct payments
