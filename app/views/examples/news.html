        <p>Spending time outdoors is a great way of improving your health and wellbeing, having fun and discovering something new about the countyâ€™s beautiful landscapes. To help you get out more this summer, we have launched the new Essex Explorer Pass which will help you save money on car parking, cafes and other attractions at Essex Country Parks.</p>
        <p>From the ornamental lakes at Danbury, to the deer park and Stick Man trail at Weald, there is something for everyone all year round. To find out more, visit the <a href="http://www.visitparks.co.uk/explorer-pass/">Essex Country Parks website</a>.</p>
