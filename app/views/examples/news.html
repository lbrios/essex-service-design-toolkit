        <p>We can now announce that Jon Jenkins, who appeared on last year's Great British Bake Off, will be at Cressing Chocolate Festival on 19 April.</p>

        <p>Jon, who became well-known for his love of bright shirts, made it to week seven on Bake Off, creating a number of fantastic bakes along the way.</p>

        <p>If you want some top tips, Jon will be making an Easter-themed chocolate ball reveal and a chocolate collar around a cake. He will also be hosting a question and answer session, so anyone attending the workshop will be able to find out more about his techniques and experience on the show.</p>

        <p>Jon said: â€œI'm really excited to be part of the inaugural Cressing Chocolate Festival on Good Friday - it promises to be a fantastic event! I'm going to be tempering chocolate to make an amazing Easter-themed chocolate ball reveal and a chocolate collar around a cake. If you want to be part of it, please do come along to Cressing Barns - I can't wait to meet everyone."</p>
