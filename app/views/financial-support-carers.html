        Financial support for carers
      </h1>
      <p>There are many costs associated with looking after someone. Here's some guidance on available financial support.</p>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">
        Carer's allowance
      </h2>
      <p>Carers may want to explore whether they are entitled to carer's allowance. Check your <a href="#">eligibility for carer's allowance</a> at GOV.UK.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">
        Carer's credit
      </h2>
      <p>
        Carer's credit is a National Insurance credit that helps with gaps in your National Insurance record. Check your <a href="#">eligibility for carer's credit</a> at GOV.UK.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">
        Council Tax discount for carers
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may be eligible for Council Tax reduction, also called 'Council Tax support' or being 'disregarded for Council Tax', if you are:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          a live-in carer
        </li>
        <li>
          are not the spouse or partner of the person you care for
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You do not have to claim carer's allowance to qualify for this discount, and your income and savings will not affect your eligibility.
      </p>
