      <p>
        A financial assessment tells us how much you can afford to pay towards your care and support.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can only be completed if you have been assessed as needing care and support. If not, you can request a <a href="https://www.livingwellessex.org/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/requesting-an-assessment">care needs assessment</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need to have some documents handy, such as bank statements and utility bills. <a href="what-you-need">See the full list of documents needed.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can save your answers as you go and return to the form later.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes around 45 minutes to complete.</p>
