      <p>Your charges will start from the first day of your care.</p>
      <p>If this is before your financial assessment is complete, you might be invoiced for the full cost of your care. We will adjust your invoice once the financial assessment is complete.</p>
      <p>You won't be charged for care if you go into hospital as you will not be receiving care and support at home.</p>

        How care charges work
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your 'assessed contribution' is the amount we calculate you can afford to pay based on your financial assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will never be asked to pay more than your assessed contribution or more than the cost of your care if this is less than your assessed contribution.
      </p>
