There is no guarantee of a place for a child living in the priority admission area of a school.</p>
        <p>Not all schools have a priority admission area. You do not have to live in the priority admission area of a school to make an application for it.</p>

The priority admission (catchment) area school for an address may not be the nearest school to that address.</p>
