<h3>Annual reassessment: why your payments might change</h3>
<p>We will review what you pay towards your care each year. This is called an annual reassessment.</p>
<p>The reassessment accounts for any changes to benefits and legislation that all local authorities must follow. It will also explain any changes to care charges.</p>
<p>We will send you a letter in late February or early March explaining the outcome of the reassessment.</p>
