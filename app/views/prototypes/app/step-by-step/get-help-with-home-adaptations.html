        <p>If you're elderly, disabled or have a long term health condition, you might be eligible for help to adapt your home.</p>
        <h3>Minor adaptations</h3>
        <p>You may be eligible for support for minor adaptations costing up to £1000.</p>
        <p>You'll need an occupational therapy (OT) assessment to see if these changes will help you manage everyday tasks at home.</p>
        <p>Contact <a href="/get-social-care-help">Adult Social Care</a> to discuss your care and support needs. The discussion may result in an occupational therapy assessment.</p>
        <h3>Disabled Facilities Grant</h3>
        <p>You may be eligible for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disabled-facilities-grants" title="GOV.UK's guidance on Disabled Facilities Grant">Disabled Facilities Grant</a> if you're disabled or have a long-term health condition and need to make changes to your home.</p>
        <h4>How to apply</h4>
        <p>You will need an <a href="/adapt-your-home-to-work-for-you/how-to-get-an-occupational-therapy-assessment">occupational therapy assessment</a> to see if you are eligible.</p>
        <p>The assessment will look at your circumstances and what sort of adaptation is suitable to meet your needs. The occupational therapist will make any recommendations to your local council.</p>
        <h4>Help you will get</h4>
        <p>How much you get depends on your financial circumstances and you may need to pay towards the cost.</p>
        <p>If you're eligible, you can get a grant for home adaptations of up to £30,000 from your local council.</p>
