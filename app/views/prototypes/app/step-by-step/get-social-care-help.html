          Adult social care: step by step
        </h1>
        <p>
          Adult social care is the support given to people with an illness 
          or disability who need care and support to help them manage on their own and stay independent. It is usually paid for.

                <p>Adult Social Care might arrange for you to have a care needs assessment. This is a more detailed conversation about your care and support with a social worker or an occupational therapist.
                  It will identify your eligible needs and what support you could get.</p>
                <p>The NHS website has more information on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/help-from-social-services-and-charities/getting-a-needs-assessment/">what happens in a care needs assessment</a>.</p>
                <p>You can have someone with you during the assessment. This could be your family, friends, carer or an <a href="advocacy">advocate to speak for you</a>.</p>
                <p>If a family member or a friend is looking after you, they might be eligible for support, see <a href="request-carers-assessment">carer’s assessment</a>.</p>
