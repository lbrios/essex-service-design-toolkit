        <h1>Are you a carer?</h1>
        <p>A 'carer' is someone who - without being paid - regularly looks after, helps or supports someone over the age of 18 who wouldn't be able to manage everyday life without their help.</p>
        <p>Carers under the age of 18 are sometimes called '<a href="/request-carers-assessment/young-carers-assessment">Young Carers</a>'.</p>
        <h2>Who you may be looking after</h2>
        <p>You may be caring for a partner, relative, friend or neighbour. For example, it may be someone who:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>has a physical or learning disability</li>
        <li>has a mental health condition</li>
        <li>is living with dementia</li>
        <li>has sight, hearing or communication difficulties</li>
        <li>has a long-term health condition</li>
        <li>misuses drugs or alcohol</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A carer doesn't have to be living with the person they care for, and the help they give doesn't have to be physical.</p>
        <h2>Things you may help do</h2>
        <p>You may be helping with:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>shopping, personal finances</li>
        <li>paperwork and administration</li>
        <li>transportation</li>
        <li>personal care, such as washing and dressing</li>
        <li>going to the toilet or dealing with incontinence</li>
        <li>eating or taking medicines</li>
        <li>getting about at home or outside</li>
        <li>practical things, like companionship</li>
        <li>counselling, emotional support or communicating</li>
        <li>attending appointments</li>
        </ul>

                <p>Adult Social Care might arrange for you to have a care needs assessment. This is a more detailed conversation about your care and support with a social worker or an occupational therapist.
                  It will identify your eligible needs and what support you could get.</p>
                <p>The NHS website has more information on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/help-from-social-services-and-charities/getting-a-needs-assessment/">what happens in a care needs assessment</a>.</p>
                <p>You can have someone with you during the assessment. This could be your family, friends, carer or an <a href="advocacy">advocate to speak for you</a>.</p>
                <p>If a family member or a friend is looking after you, they might be eligible for support, see <a href="request-carers-assessment">carer’s assessment</a>.</p>
