    <h1>Are you a carer?</h1>
<p>A 'carer' is someone who - without being paid - regularly looks after, helps or supports someone over the age of 18 who wouldn't be able to manage everyday life without their help.</p>
<p>Carers under the age of 18 are sometimes called '<a href="/request-carers-assessment/young-carers-assessment">Young Carers</a>'.</p>
<h2>Who you may be looking after</h2>
<p>You may be caring for a partner, relative, friend or neighbour. For example, it may be someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a physical or learning disability</li>
<li>has a mental health condition</li>
<li>is living with dementia</li>
<li>has sight, hearing or communication difficulties</li>
<li>has a long-term health condition</li>
<li>misuses drugs or alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>A carer doesn't have to be living with the person they care for, and the help they give doesn't have to be physical.</p>
<h2>Things you may help do</h2>
<p>You may be helping with:</p>
<ul>
<li>shopping, personal finances</li>
<li>paperwork and administration</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>personal care, such as washing and dressing</li>
<li>going to the toilet or dealing with incontinence</li>
<li>eating or taking medicines</li>
<li>getting about at home or outside</li>
<li>practical things, like companionship</li>
<li>counselling, emotional support or communicating</li>
<li>attending appointments</li>
</ul>
