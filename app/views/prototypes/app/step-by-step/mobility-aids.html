<h2 id="mobility-aids"> Mobility aids</h2>
<p>If you have difficulty walking or getting around, a wheelchair, scooter or walking aid may help.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/care-services-equipment-and-care-homes/walking-aids-wheelchairs-and-mobility-scooters/" title="NHS website">NHS website</a> explains how you can get equipment to meet your mobility needs.</p>
<h3>Wheelchairs</h3>
<p>To be eligible for a wheelchair loan you will need to have a long term disability which affects your ability to walk. You will need to be referred by your GP for an assessment at your local wheelchair service. This depends on where you live.</p>
