        <h1>Advocacy</h1>
        <p>An advocate is a person who can support you and speak on your behalf if you want them to.</p>
        <p>Advocacy services help you access information and ensure your voice is heard when decisions that affect you are being made.</p>
        <h2>Why use an advocate?</h2>
        <p>Advocates are independent. They don't represent the views of others, such as your local authority or the NHS.</p>
        <p>They won't make decisions for you or give you their personal opinion.</p>
        <p>An advocate can:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>contact people on your behalf</li>
        <li>go to meetings with you to give you support</li>
        <li>speak on your behalf when you don't feel comfortable speaking yourself</li>
        <li>write letters and emails on your behalf</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Situations where you may need an advocate</h2>
        <p>Advocates can be used in lots of situations. For example, they can help if you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>need support to attend interviews about benefits</li>
        <li>need help dealing with housing problems</li>
        <li>want to complain about treatment or healthcare</li>
        <li>are a victim of crime or antisocial behaviour</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In certain situations you have a legal right to the following types of advocacy:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Independent Mental Capacity Advocacy (IMCA) which supports people who lack capacity to make certain decisions</li>
        <li>Independent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) which supports people treated or assessed under the Mental Health Act</li>
        <li>Independent Care Act Advocacy (ICAA) which supports people who are receiving or being assessed for care</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Advocacy services in Essex</h2>

                <p>They will ask you about what’s important to you, what you can manage yourself, what additional support you may need and how you’re
