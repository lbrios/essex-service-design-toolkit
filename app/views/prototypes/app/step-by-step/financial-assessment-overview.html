<h2 id="financial-assessment-overview"> Overview</h2>
<p>A financial assessment tells us how much you can afford to pay towards your care and support. It looks at your:</p>
<ul>
<li>income – such as pensions and benefits</li>
<li>assets – such as savings, investments, property and land</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not look at the income or property of your partner in the financial assessment.</p>
<h3>Eligibility for financial support</h3>
<p>If your income and assets are:</p>
<ul>
<li>less than £23,250, you will be eligible for means-tested support to help pay for your care</li>
<li>more than £23,250, you will have to pay the full cost of your care</li>
</ul>
<h4>The value of your home</h4>
<p>We won’t include the value of your home in the financial assessment if you have care at home, also called domiciliary and non-residential care. We will include the value of additional properties you own.</p>
<p>We will normally include the value of your home if you permanently move to a care home. See <a href="/paying-for-a-care-home">paying for a care home</a>.</p>
