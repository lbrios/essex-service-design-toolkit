<h2 id="young-carers-assessment"> Young carer&#x27;s assessment</h2>
<p>Looking after someone in your family can be rewarding, but it can also be difficult, and be especially hard for young people.</p>
<p>It may make things more difficult at school, mean you don't have time to go out with your friends, do homework, or do things you'd like to do.</p>
<h3>What is a young carer?</h3>
<p>You are a young carer if you're under 18 and you look after someone in your family who:</p>
<ul>
<li>is ill or disabled</li>
<li>uses drugs or alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>This person could be a parent, grandparent, brother, or sister.</p>
<h3>How we can help</h3>
<p>Young carers are entitled to a young carer's assessment.</p>
<p>This involves speaking to you, the person being cared for, and the rest of your immediate family, if relevant.</p>
<p>The kinds of support you may be offered could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>access to a young carers group with peer support, information, advice, and guidance from specialist staff</li>
<li>opportunities to take a break</li>
<li>support with issues at work, school or college</li>
</ul>
<p>Other services may be provided depending on what you need.</p>
